    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutral (Stone, Slate, Muted Sage) -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application now presents two distinct views. It begins with a "Research Synopsis" for user trust. The first major section is a "Top 10 Regional Comparison" with its own table, chart, and recommendations. The second major section is a comprehensive "Top 20+ National Comparison" with its own separate table and filters. A new "Facility Checker" section has been added to provide context on why some well-known hospitals may not be on the curated lists. This layered approach allows users to focus on local options first, then expand to a national benchmark, providing both focus and context. A "Key Questions" section has been restored at the end. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Bar Charts (Chart.js): Now include detailed explanatory text and color-coding by facility type to provide critical context for users in crisis.
        - Two Interactive Tables (HTML/JS): Separate, independently filterable grids for regional and national data, with contextual filter explanations.
        - Descriptive Badges (HTML/JS): Clarify the distinct roles of LTACHs vs. Rehab Hospitals.
        - Modal with Tabs (HTML/JS): A single modal function serves both tables to display deep information.
        - Card Layout (HTML/JS): Presents Top Recommendations with enhanced detail.
        - Confidence Indicators (HTML/JS): Provides data verification guidance directly in the UI.
